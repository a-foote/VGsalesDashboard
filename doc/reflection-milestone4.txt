#Milestone 4 Reflection
This is a reflection on the development of the Video Game Sales dashboard, implemented with Dash in Python and Altair.

### Ease of Use

The app is very easy to use. Tabs are laid out clearly and plots follow a logical sequence.

### Feedback Themes

Most feedback was around minor aesthetic issues such choice of font colour, plot size, and active pill background colour.

### Value Feedback
The most valuable feedback we received was centered around other users viewing this dashboard on different size screens.
